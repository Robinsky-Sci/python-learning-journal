## A repository to document my Python learning journey
### About me:
27-year-old professional looking to deepen their understanding of coding and its uses within data science. I have been working in a sales and business development capacity within the telecoms industry, and want to build myself a stronger resume for future positions within marketing departments. Having had an internship at a MedTech company, I also want the ability to understand the daily life of engineers to understand some of the issues they face to better understand the pipeline of software creation. 
### Goals:
#### Create a basic understanding of Python
#### Understanding what it takes to complete coding projects and how software engineers function from a bottom-up perspective 
### My first Python project:
Print("Hello World")
